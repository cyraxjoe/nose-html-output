Nose-html-output plugin
=======================

A plugin for nosetests that will write out test results to results.html.

The code is adapted from the `example html output plugin`_ and the
`pyunit Html test runner`_.

This is an alternative ``nosehtmloutput`` (hence ``alt-nose-html-output`` ) plugin that
is not integrated to openstack.
